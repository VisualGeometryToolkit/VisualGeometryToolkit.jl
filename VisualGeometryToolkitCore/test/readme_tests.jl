# readme_tests.jl — the README's example and the documentation's first example
# run as written, in a clean environment that holds exactly what the README's
# install line adds. A reader's first contact with the package is that code; it
# once called `has_boundary`, which is public but not exported (General
# registration review, #171997), and later examples used a `camera`, an `img`
# and a `matrix` they never defined. The same review asked the stack for this
# test (#173031, #174579).
#
# The install line is a `pkg>` block (```julia-repl), so it is not run as code:
# the item checks that it names every non-standard-library package the
# examples load, and nothing else. The examples then run in a child Julia
# process in a temporary environment — this package by path, the rest of the
# install line from the registries — with none of the test run's load path.
