# VisualGeometryToolkitEstimation changelog

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

### Added

- **`fit_rotation_averaging(relative[, prior])`**, robust rotation averaging on
  a view graph: VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `spectral_rotation_averaging` seed,
  then the Lie-algebra IRLS of Chatterjee & Govindu over every edge (a sparse
  linear solve per iteration, a stack loss shape at the χ²₃-median scale);
  `[fit_rotation_averaging]`.
- **`RotationProblem` and `find_rotation`**: the pure rotation between two
  calibrated views (the infinite homography) by RANSAC on unit bearings with
  their back-projection Jacobians — VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `Rotation2pt`,
  the Sampson distance of the joint measurement (`Σ = I`) to the bearing
  transfer constraint, in pixels, the chart-LM refit
  on VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `SO3Manifold` through the transfer rows;
  `[pipelines.rotation]` (1 px, the essential problem's convention). The
  bearing checks and the sub-detector half-width refusal of the essential
  problem are shared (`_BearingProblem`).
- **`fit_linear(A, y[, prior])`**, the robust coefficients of a linear model:
  a reweighted least squares under a loss shape (default Huber at its
  efficiency constant 1.345) at the residuals' MAD scale, with fixed prior row
  weights; `configs/default.toml` `[fit_linear]`. Hoisted from
  RadiometricCamera's rooftop vignetting fit.

- **A `refine_*` for every `find_*`** — `refine_homography`, `refine_fundmat`,
  `refine_essential`, `refine_absolute_pose`, `refine_rotation`,
  `refine_radial_homography`, `refine_radial_camera`, `refine_hand_eye`,
  `refine_circle`, `refine_ellipse`: the `find_*`'s local optimization alone,
  run once from a given model (`locally_optimize` with the class's
  `[pipelines.<class>]` defaults). The model leads, then the `find_*`'s data;
  the keywords are the `find_*`'s strategy keywords (`threshold`, `scoring`,
  `local_optimization`, `workspace`, and its model-specific ones) without the
  sampling ones, so any local-optimization strategy plugs in.
- `EllipseProblem` provides the one model covariance (`solver_covariance`),
  so predictive scoring and an ellipse's covariance on its inliers.

### Changed

- **`Triggs` defaults to Welsch** in `[pipelines.circle]` and
  `[pipelines.ellipse]` (`Triggs{WelschShape}(scale_multiple = 2.5)`, was
  Cauchy; the multiple in Welsch's own currency): on a fisheye image circle's
  contour the Cauchy ellipse sat ~0.9 px from the inliers' least squares, the
  Welsch one on it. `Triggs{K}` admits exactly the shapes `Irls{K}` does, and
  `Triggs{GaussianShape}` is the plain chart LM, with no width.
- **`refine_ellipse(ellipse, points; kwargs...)`** (was `refine_ellipse(points,
  init = direct_ellipse(points); max_iter)`): the guess is required (a
  self-seeding refine is a fit) and the result is a `RansacEstimate`. The
  orthogonal (foot-point) distance it minimized is now the `EllipseProblem`'s
  refit rows, so `find_ellipse` and every strategy descend it; the Sampson
  distance still scores. Plain least squares is `local_optimization =
  Irls{GaussianShape}()` at a threshold above every residual; the covariance
  is `s²·solver_covariance(EllipseProblem(points), e, inliers)`.
- **`refine_absolute_pose(pose, camera, pairs; kwargs...)`** (was
  `refine_absolute_pose(pose, bearings; max_iter)`): `find_absolute_pose`'s
  step on the `AbsolutePoseProblem` rows, `X => u` pixel pairs through the
  camera (any lens; rays past 90°). On clean data it returns the same pose as
  the bearing form did (both to 1e-15); on 0.3 px noise the two differ by
  ≤ 6e-7.

### Removed

- The bearing and generalized (ray-origin) forms of `refine_absolute_pose`,
  its `max_iter` and `[refine_absolute_pose]`, and `AbsolutePoseRefineMetadata`;
  `EllipseFitMetadata`. A non-central camera's pose has no problem to host it
  yet.
