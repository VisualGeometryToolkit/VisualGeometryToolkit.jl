# VisualGeometryToolkitEstimation changelog

## 0.4.0 (2026-11-02)

- NLLSsolver ≥ 5.3.1: the relative-pose bundle always uses NLLSsolver's typed
  `OptimizeCache` (its internal `cache` keyword is gone; `schur = false` still
  forces the sparse LDL while upstream #60 is open).

- Follows VisualGeometryToolkitCore's Sampson layers: the essential problem's
  residual is `only(sampson_residual(E, f₁, f₂; M₁, M₂))` and the division
  lift's `‖g‖²` is `constraint(m, X, x)`.
- One Sampson path, ONE chart-rows method: every chart problem whose residual
  is its constraint's whitened Sampson residual — F, E, H, the circle, the
  radial camera and the rotation — descends VisualGeometryToolkitCore's
  `whitened_residuals!`/`whitened_jacobian_rows!` over its `cs` (its noise and
  keyword columns, the LM's √w as `sqrt_weights`), at the chart's model, along
  its `retract_jacobian`; the per-problem row methods and the epipolar stamping
  are gone (`_constraint_model(problem, chart, a)` is the one per-problem fact,
  the rotation's bearing transfer form).
- Breaking in results: **the homography's and the rotation's LM descend the
  exact rows** of the residual they are scored with — the algebraic constraint
  whitened by the endpoints' noise for H (an exact source: the transfer error),
  the bearing transfer form for the rotation — with the whitening re-evaluated
  at every iterate and its derivative carried, instead of a transfer whitening
  frozen at the chart's anchor (a different function away from the anchor,
  whose fixed point is not the Sampson cost's minimum). Measured: H's refined
  models move ≤ 1.3e-5 relative (Frobenius, unit-normalized), the transfer RMS
  on the inliers by ≤ 3e-7 px, the inlier sets unchanged, the Sampson cost at
  the new fixed point lower (10.1491997 vs 10.1492046 on the test scene); the
  rotation ≤ 4.1e-7; an exact-source board homography unchanged (5e-16).
- The pool record's residual matrix is `sampson_distances!` and its RSS a
  composition of `sampson_distance`.
- Every problem's constraint is `(g, G_x, G_θ)`: a correspondence's noise is its
  `measurement_covariance(problem, i)` (the `Σ₁`/`Σ₂` columns; a line fit's
  per-point shapes) and its rounding scale `constraint_rounding_scale(problem,
  model, i)` (H, F, E, circle, ellipse, radial camera). The homography's
  data-frame model is its `residual_context`, formed once per model.
- Breaking: the whitening-policy keyword of `fit_radial_camera`,
  `fit_division_camera` and `division_camera_step` is removed with no
  replacement: the fits always whiten (the rows' frozen `whitening_factor`)
  from their second iteration; `fit_radial_camera(…; iterations = 1)` is the
  algebraic solve.
- Results: every `find_*`/`fit_*` agrees with 0.2 to ≤ 7e-14 relative except
  where a chart LM stops at its tolerance on rows now rounded in another order
  (`find_fundmat`: ≤ 7e-8 px on any residual, the inlier set unchanged).

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-29)

### Added

- **`fit_rotation_averaging(relative[, prior])`**, robust rotation averaging on
  a view graph: VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `spectral_rotation_averaging` seed,
  then the Lie-algebra IRLS of Chatterjee & Govindu over every edge (a sparse
  linear solve per iteration, a stack loss shape at the χ²₃-median scale);
  `[fit_rotation_averaging]`.
- **`RotationProblem` and `find_rotation`**: the pure rotation between two
  calibrated views (the infinite homography) by RANSAC on unit bearings with
  their back-projection Jacobians — VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `Rotation2pt`,
  the Sampson distance of the joint measurement (`Σ = I`) to the bearing
  transfer constraint, in pixels, the chart-LM refit
  on VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `SO3Manifold` through the transfer rows;
  `[pipelines.rotation]` (1 px, the essential problem's convention). The
  bearing checks and the sub-detector half-width refusal of the essential
  problem are shared (`_BearingProblem`).
- **`fit_linear(A, y[, prior])`**, the robust coefficients of a linear model:
  a reweighted least squares under a loss shape (default Huber at its
  efficiency constant 1.345) at the residuals' MAD scale, with fixed prior row
  weights; `configs/default.toml` `[fit_linear]`. Hoisted from
  RadiometricCamera's rooftop vignetting fit.

- **A `refine_*` for every `find_*`** — `refine_homography`, `refine_fundmat`,
  `refine_essential`, `refine_absolute_pose`, `refine_rotation`,
  `refine_radial_homography`, `refine_radial_camera`, `refine_hand_eye`,
  `refine_circle`, `refine_ellipse`: the `find_*`'s local optimization alone,
  run once from a given model (`locally_optimize` with the class's
  `[pipelines.<class>]` defaults). The model leads, then the `find_*`'s data;
  the keywords are the `find_*`'s strategy keywords (`threshold`, `scoring`,
  `local_optimization`, `workspace`, and its model-specific ones) without the
  sampling ones, so any local-optimization strategy plugs in.
- `EllipseProblem` provides the one model covariance (`solver_covariance`),
  so predictive scoring and an ellipse's covariance on its inliers.

### Changed

- **`Triggs` defaults to Welsch** in `[pipelines.circle]` and
  `[pipelines.ellipse]` (`Triggs{WelschShape}(scale_multiple = 2.5)`, was
  Cauchy; the multiple in Welsch's own currency): on a fisheye image circle's
  contour the Cauchy ellipse sat ~0.9 px from the inliers' least squares, the
  Welsch one on it. `Triggs{K}` admits exactly the shapes `Irls{K}` does, and
  `Triggs{GaussianShape}` is the plain chart LM, with no width.
- **`refine_ellipse(ellipse, points; kwargs...)`** (was `refine_ellipse(points,
  init = direct_ellipse(points); max_iter)`): the guess is required (a
  self-seeding refine is a fit) and the result is a `RansacEstimate`. The
  orthogonal (foot-point) distance it minimized is now the `EllipseProblem`'s
  refit rows, so `find_ellipse` and every strategy descend it; the Sampson
  distance still scores. Plain least squares is `local_optimization =
  Irls{GaussianShape}()` at a threshold above every residual; the covariance
  is `s²·solver_covariance(EllipseProblem(points), e, inliers)`.
- **`refine_absolute_pose(pose, camera, pairs; kwargs...)`** (was
  `refine_absolute_pose(pose, bearings; max_iter)`): `find_absolute_pose`'s
  step on the `AbsolutePoseProblem` rows, `X => u` pixel pairs through the
  camera (any lens; rays past 90°). On clean data it returns the same pose as
  the bearing form did (both to 1e-15); on 0.3 px noise the two differ by
  ≤ 6e-7. The refined pose carries the guess's frame labels (frames.md rule 1),
  in both forms.
- **`refine_absolute_pose(pose, bearings; kwargs...)`** keeps its bearing and
  generalized (ray-origin) forms, now inside the refine interface: `X => f`
  unit bearings with optional `origins`, `M` (pixel whitening) and `weights`
  columns, on the new **`BearingPoseProblem`** (the `MinimalSolveProblem` of
  `Extrinsics3` with a `BearingPoseContext`; `AbsolutePoseProblem` is now the
  one with a `PoseContext`) whose rows are the old whitened tangent-plane
  residual. Defaults `[pipelines.bearing_pose]`: least squares over every
  correspondence (`Irls{GaussianShape}()`, the threshold a fraction of the
  residual's bound), the same pose as the previous bearing form to ≤ 8e-14 on
  pinhole, 110° fisheye and non-central scenes, clean and at 0.3 px; any
  strategy plugs in (`Triggs`, `Irls{K}`). Refine-only for a non-central
  camera (no generalized minimal solver: `solve` refuses it). `max_iter` is
  gone (the cap is the strategy's): drop it from the call.

### Removed

- `refine_absolute_pose`'s `max_iter` and `[refine_absolute_pose]`, and
  `AbsolutePoseRefineMetadata` (its result is a `RansacEstimate`);
  `EllipseFitMetadata`.
