# VisualGeometryToolkitEstimation changelog

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

### Added

- **`fit_rotation_averaging(relative[, prior])`**, robust rotation averaging on
  a view graph: VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `spectral_rotation_averaging` seed,
  then the Lie-algebra IRLS of Chatterjee & Govindu over every edge (a sparse
  linear solve per iteration, a stack loss shape at the χ²₃-median scale);
  `[fit_rotation_averaging]`.
- **`RotationProblem` and `find_rotation`**: the pure rotation between two
  calibrated views (the infinite homography) by RANSAC on unit bearings with
  their back-projection Jacobians — VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `Rotation2pt`,
  the Sampson distance of the joint measurement (`Σ = I`) to the bearing
  transfer constraint, in pixels, the chart-LM refit
  on VisualGeometryToolkitCore's `SO3Manifold` through the transfer rows;
  `[pipelines.rotation]` (1 px, the essential problem's convention). The
  bearing checks and the sub-detector half-width refusal of the essential
  problem are shared (`_BearingProblem`).
- **`fit_linear(A, y[, prior])`**, the robust coefficients of a linear model:
  a reweighted least squares under a loss shape (default Huber at its
  efficiency constant 1.345) at the residuals' MAD scale, with fixed prior row
  weights; `configs/default.toml` `[fit_linear]`. Hoisted from
  RadiometricCamera's rooftop vignetting fit.

### Known limits

- **`refine_absolute_pose` whitens a generalized camera's residuals only
  approximately.** This applies to the generalized form (an `origins`
  column) with pixel whitening (an `M` column). The whitening maps the error
  in each ray's direction to pixels and holds the ray's origin fixed. It
  ignores `∂o/∂u`, how the origin moves with the pixel. For a non-central
  camera the residual is therefore a pixel residual to first order in the
  direction only. A column for each origin's Jacobian is a later extension.
